					<p>Hi, my name is Anna, and Iâ€™m a photographer from Thornbury, Bristol.</p>

					<p>Being a photographer is my absolute dream job, and I have a massive<!--  <- maybe change this word to something that sounds better? -->  <br>
					passion for capturing those magical &amp; once in a lifetime moments  for you, <br>
					that you will be able to treasure forever.</p>

					<p>I'll happily cover a range of photography from family photos to weddings, <br>
					pets, and even boudoir! I am also dipping my toe into videography too. </p>
					
					<p>I have recently bought a top of the line camera and lens, plus a wide <br>
					array of new equipment so I'll be set up for any event - rain or shine! &#9748;</p>

					<p>Feel free to contact me to ask about prices, availability, or any questions <br>
					you may have.</p>

					<p>I look forward to hearing from you, Anna :) </p>
